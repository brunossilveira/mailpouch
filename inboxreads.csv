Week 1: We choose whether to commit to that month‚Äôs discussion. If we‚Äôre in, we read and annotate the article.

Week 2: We share our first impressions and topics we want to explore. If we have questions for the author, we ask those, too.

Week 3: The author answers our questions on a podcast. Then we reflect on what we heard and if our thoughts have changed.

Week 4: We discuss the article together. We also reflect on how to make our club even better next month.

culture,Article Club,"We read and discuss one great article every month on race, education, or culture. Join us!","race,education,culture,news","We all love to read. But sometimes it‚Äôs hard to carve out time to read deeply. It‚Äôs also hard to find other thoughtful people to connect with about what we‚Äôve read.

That‚Äôs what Article Club is for!

Article Club is a new experiment in community reading. Each month, we do a deep dive on one outstanding article, centering on topics of race, education, and culture. We read and annotate and discuss the article, along with the author.

Each month is broken up into four weeks:

Week 1: We choose whether to commit to that month‚Äôs discussion. If we‚Äôre in, we read and annotate the article.

Week 2: We share our first impressions and topics we want to explore. If we have questions for the author, we ask those, too.

Week 3: The author answers our questions on a podcast. Then we reflect on what we heard and if our thoughts have changed.

Week 4: We discuss the article together. We also reflect on how to make our club even better next month.

Thank you for your interest!",,weekly,http://articleclub.org

Week 1: We choose whether to commit to that month‚Äôs discussion. If we‚Äôre in, we read and annotate the article.

Week 2: We share our first impressions and topics we want to explore. If we have questions for the author, we ask those, too.

Week 3: The author answers our questions on a podcast. Then we reflect on what we heard and if our thoughts have changed.

Week 4: We discuss the article together. We also reflect on how to make our club even better next month.
